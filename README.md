**NeoPixel Ring - 12 x 5050 RGBW LEDs w/ Integrated Drivers - Natural White - ~4500K** \
https://www.adafruit.com/product/2852
- 37mm ring with 12 individually addressable RGBW LEDs
- 8-bit PWM per channel (8 x 4 channels = 32-bit color overall)
- The PWM is built into each LED-chip - set the color and it continues to PWM all the LEDs
- Single microcontroller pin controls all 12 neopixels and more can be chained on
- Each LED has ~18mA constant current drive
- 5v power supply
